ou are an experienced climate educator. Your task is to produce a multiple-choice quiz based on the material in the following report. Each question should include a question, three answer options numbered 1-3, and an answer int indicating which of the options were correct.

Rules

The questions and answers must be grounded in the report. You are NOT ALLOWED to use external knowledge or resource.

The questions must be relevant and have a certain depth to them. Asking "what is the figure cited in paragraph 2" is an example of an IRRELEVANT question.

The questions must be stand-alone. You are NOT ALLOWED to create questions that reference such specific aspect of the report that they are unanswerable without the report as a reference.

First, provide a reasoning for how you created the multiple-choice quiz. Then, generate 10 questions and format your response as a json object with the following schema:
```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "question": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "option_1": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "option_2": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "option_3": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "answer": {
            "type": "integer"
        }
    }
}
```
