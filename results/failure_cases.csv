7;What has been the trend in the annual area of drylands in drought?;Increased by slightly more than 1% per year;2;-1;This information is not contained in the provided text.
18;What is the global trend of annual emissions since 1990?;No clear trend;3;1;The text indicates that over time since 1990 there hasn't been a clear change in CO2 leaking from the land, but other data about methane show increasing trend
21;Global models and national GHG inventories use what kind of methods to estimate anthropogenic CO2 emissions?;Different, but are in close agreement for land-use change involving forest;2;-1;The document does not contain specific details comparing the methods used by global models and national GHG inventories.
24;Approximately what percentage of total anthropogenic GHG emissions do emissions within the farm gate and from agricultural land expansion contribute to?;16-27%;2;-1;The document states that if we count all the steps in making food, it could be responsible for 21-37% of the bad gases made, but does not specify the contribution of emissions within the farm gate and from agricultural land expansion.
27;What does the report conclude about the projected trend of emissions from agricultural production?;They are projected to increase;3;-1;The report does not explicitly state whether emissions from agricultural production will increase, decrease or remain the same.
38;According to the report, what could an increase in global mean surface temperature lead to?;Contraction of polar climate zones;3;2;Page 14 says that dry places are getting bigger as the earth warms, and page 13 defines desertification as land becoming like a desert.
50;What is a key factor that exacerbates risks related to food security?;Lower incomes;1;-1;The report discusses issues with food security, but does not include lower incomes as a direct risk factor, rather it states 821 million people are still hungry, implying poverty.
53;What does the report say about the barriers to adaptation and global mitigation?;There are some barriers;2;3;The report indicates it's hard to implement actions due to lack of money, tools and know-how, therefore large barriers exist.
58;What is a general trend noted about response options?;Most response options can be applied without competing for land;2;1;The report indicates that response options can compete for land, highlighting the need for careful land management.
62;According to the report, what does the transition to low or moderate risk look like in SSP1?;It occurs with a large amount of bioenergy or BECCS use;1;2;The report mentions that SSP1 uses a small amount of bioenergy
68;What is the estimated global sequestration potential of cover crops?;0.44 GtCO2 yr-1;2;-1;The report does not mention the specific sequestration potential of cover crops. 
89;Soil erosion from agricultural fields is currently estimated to be how many times higher than the soil formation rate with conventional tillage?;More than 100 times;3;-1;This information is not available in the document.
100;What has climate change already affected due to warming and changing precipitation patterns?;Crop yields in many lower-latitude regions;2;3;Slide 16 states that 'This makes it harder to grow food in some places,' and 'For example, crops like corn and wheat don't grow as well in some warm places now.' and 'But in some cooler places, these crops grow a little better!' indicating warming has affected crop yields in both lower and higher latitudes.
103;What are the main drivers of CO2 emissions from land use and land-use change?;Deforestation;1;3;Slide 18 states 'When we cut down forests, it's like squeezing the sponge and releasing CO2 into the air. This is called deforestation' and 'When we plant new trees, it's like soaking the sponge and taking CO2 out of the air. This is called afforestation and reforestation.'
105;What are global models and national GHG inventories used for?;Both of the above;3;-1;The slides do not mention the uses of global models and national GHG inventories. So the answer cannot be determined from the provided context.
112;What have human activities led to since the pre-industrial period?;Both of the above;3;1;Slide 26 mentions human activities have released extra CO2, and slide 26 says human activities have made the land reflect more sunlight. Therefore, human activities have led to a net release of CO2.
128;Changes in climate can amplify what type of migration?;Environmentally induced migration;1;3;Changes in climate can amplify both environmentally and socially induced migration.
129;What has unsustainable land management led to?;Negative economic impacts;2;3;Unsustainable land management leads to negative environmental impacts like desertification and negative economic impacts by reducing productive land.
153;What does climate change lead to, even with the implementation of measures intended to avoid, reduce or reverse land degradation?;Limits to adaptation;2;3;The text mentions that climate change can lead to land degradation and can make it harder for people to live in dry areas, which is a limit to adaptation.
156;Diversification in the food system can reduce what?;Risks from climate change;1;3;The text indicates that food systems need many types of plants and animals and that when one crop fails, there needs to be alternatives. This also indicates that diversification can also hedge against market fluctuations.
159;Most mitigation pathways include substantial deployment of what?;Bioenergy technologies;1;3;The text mentions bioenergy, and also refers to needing to capture bad air implying carbon capture.
160;What does appropriate design of policies, institutions and governance systems at all scales contribute to?;Both of the above;3;-1;The document does not directly state what appropriate design of policies contributes to, but it broadly discusses land related adaptation and mitigation.
161;Which of the following instruments can achieve positive adaptation and mitigation outcomes?;All of the above;3;-1;The document does not specifically list land use zoning and spatial planning as instruments for achieving positive outcomes.
164;A mix of policies, rather than single policy approaches, can do what?;Both of the above;3;-1;The document doesn't specify results of a mix of policies.
165;Policies that operate across the food system enable what?;All of the above;3;-1;The document does not explicitly state outcomes for policies operating across the food system.
166;Policies that enable and incentivise sustainable land management include what?;All of the above;3;-1;The document mentions empowering women and access to markets as ways to help, but does not specifically say it is about policies that enable sustainable land management
168;What can facilitate adaptation and enhanced resilience to extreme events impacting food systems?;All of the above;3;-1;The document does not provide information on how to facilitate adaptation and resilience.
169;Public health policies to improve nutrition can potentially do what?;All of the above;3;-1;The document does not discuss public health policies, but it mentions eating healthy food is good for the body and the planet.
171;What can addressing desertification, land degradation, and food security in an integrated manner assist?;Climate resilient development;1;3;The information on slides 6 and 45 implies an integrated approach assists in both, especially considering that land degradation leads to desertification and food insecurity.
173;What does coordination with other sectors increase?;Co-benefits;1;3;Slide 91 states that when making rules about land and food it can help in more than one way, by showing co-benefits and also implying there could be co-risks if not planned correctly.
177;What can inclusiveness in the measurement, reporting and verification of the performance of policy instruments support?;Sustainable land management;1;-1;The document does not explicitly state this relationship, therefore, I cannot infer an answer.
